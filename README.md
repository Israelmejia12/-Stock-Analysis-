## Results

### There was a total of 12 Stocks in our data.Of all the stocks available on two perform well in both 2017 and 2018. 
Although 2017 was a good year for the company having only one stock performing bad, namely TERP which negative result of -7.2%,
I would advise Steve and his family to find a different company to invest on as it this company seem to perform bad on 2018.

One can also in the process rectoring code might acidently damage the with too many changes. 
One thing that can help in case one runs into problem is to oftenly save the file into Github so that if something bad happens a copy of it will be ready to be use.
